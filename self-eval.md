# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - Felt a little lost at times, but very satisfied and accomplished when able to figure out a problem.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - Flow is good. When I sit down its usually for 2 hours and in that i take about two 10 min breaks. I could use more time to study new material or things that aren't outlined in the learning.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - Start early and manage time. I had something going on this weekend that blew up my work. I've planned not to have anything going on during the course and this was to clear up my time moving forward.
